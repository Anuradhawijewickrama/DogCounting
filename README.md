# DogCounting
University SS project

This is the project that we are doing in our short semester period department of computer engineering university of peradeniya
and we are doing this project colobarate with faculty of vetinary science university of peradeniya

Stray dogs are one of a main problem in srilanka. people are bitten by dogs, lots of road accidents happen because of 
stray dogs and the government spent lot of money for treat that patients and also stray dogs become very annoying thing to people.

But the problem is the parties who is resposible for this matter could not be able to find the exact ammount of stray dogs in sriLanka
and what are the places that they are roaming most of the time in a single day.

We are going to give a smart sollution to this problem using smart devices. We are going to create a android app, and when app user 
catch any stray dog he or she can enter about that dog tho this app and we gain that information to our database system. when someone
need to get a information about some area like how many stray dogs in that area or what are the places that stray dogs mostly roaming
and also some can know how many stray dogs are in specific place or specific country.
